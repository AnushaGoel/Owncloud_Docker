Project_on_Docker


I have completed my first Docker project under the guidance of Vimal Daga sir,who delivered the docker training.This project is under
IIEC-Rise.
It was a huge oppurtunity for getting training on Docker.


Requirements for this:-

  1)Firstly,operating system-RedHat 8

  2)Secondly,Install docker on it

  3)Third,download docker-compose
